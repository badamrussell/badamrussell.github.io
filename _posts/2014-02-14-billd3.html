  My first attempt at D3.js using data from the <a href="http://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/">sunlight foundation</a> api. Still a work in progress.
</p>
<p>
  Every bill has several stages of voting. Clicking on each will move the little legislators to where they voted on the bill. This allows you to see each voting stage and the various ways it breaks down in the various 'Yeas' and 'Nays'. You can see the splits by:
  <ul>
    <li>political party (red/blue/green color)</li>
    <li>rough age of legislators (circle diameter)</li>
    <li>states</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>While the context of each voting is still a mystery, manipulating the data into something visual and interesting was great practice. Still more to do!</p>
