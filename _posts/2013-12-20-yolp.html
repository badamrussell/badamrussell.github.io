  Yolp is a faux-site that was created for educational purposes. The idea was to take an existing site that had a lot going on and try to replicate its functionality. This way, I did not have to worry about the design aspects and could concentrate on functionality and essentially practice programming in a bigger sandbox.
</p>
<p>
  So Yolp is a reconstruction of the popular restaurant reviewing website yelp.com. It is filled with lots of fake data including users, businesses, and reviews.

  I subscribed to <a href="http://codeclimate.com">CodeClimate</a> to help focus on improving my code. It helped a lot in finding problem areas. And despite the high rating, it still needs more refactoring. I still have some Laws of Demeter violations and some more organization.
