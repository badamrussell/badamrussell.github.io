<p>
  The game supports up to 4 players.
</p>
<p>
  Rounds of betting continue until all players have folded, or matched bets.
</p>
<p>
  The program can determine the highest value of a particular hand, give the name of it (like "Royal Flush" or "Two Pair") and calculates a numerical value for the hand, so it can break ties.
